# Employee-Management-System

In the current employee management system, admin adds new regulations and assigns them to the department manually. Department Head sends these regulations to the individual users through mail to get their consent. Users send their comments through the courier service after reading regulations. Department head has to collect the user inputs and pass them on to Admin. Since a lot of manual workflow is involved, it is time consuming for admin to close each regulation. So, a new system is required to automate this regulation creation and closure process.
